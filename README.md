## Installation

We strongly recommend using a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 🔧 Install External Binaries

Download the following ZIP files from the latest [VGSync Release](https://github.com/ridewithoutstomach/VGSync/releases/tag/v3.27):

- [ffmpeg.zip](https://github.com/ridewithoutstomach/VGSync/releases/download/binaries-ffmpeg-mpv-v1/ffmpeg.zip) → extract into: `ffmpeg/`
- [mpv.zip](https://github.com/ridewithoutstomach/VGSync/releases/download/binaries-ffmpeg-mpv-v1/mpv.zip) → extract into: `mpv/`


The folders `ffmpeg/` and `mpv/` contain `VGSync_ffmpeg.txt` and `VGSync_mpv.txt` as guidance.

## Running the Application

```bash
python VGSync.py
```

## Pre-Built Windows Executable

If you prefer not to install Python or deal with dependencies manually, you can use the **pre-built Windows binary**:

1. Download the ZIP file (`VGSync_3.27_Win_x64.zip` or similarly named `VGSync_[VERSION]_Win_x64.zip`) from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/ridewithoutstomach/VGSync/releases).
2. Extract the ZIP file into any folder of your choice.
3. Double-click `VGSync.exe` to run the application.

## Building the Windows Executable

```bash
python build_with_pyinstaller.py
```

The resulting `.exe` file will be located at:

```
dist/VGSync_3.27/VGSync.exe
```
